I'm planning on giving away my early 2000s _Artforum_ magazines soon but I decided to page through them one last time for any interesting or historic articles. I stumbled upon the Hotlist column which invited a guest columnist to write about 5-6 websites of interest to the art world. I'm not going to review all the sites listed over 2 years but it's fun to see who wrote the columns, what sites and projects are still online, and what I remember from the early years of art on the WWW. 

More to come.
