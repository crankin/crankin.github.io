A couple of days ago I enabled the little badge on Instapaper to show my unread count. My kids laughed at me when they noticed it was 358. I'm not sure they'd still be laughing when they saw my newsfeed unread count or my Tumblr unread count or my Pinboard unread count. Plus I'm sure the amount of time I spend reading Twitter everyday could be considered **problematic**. 

I don't even want to think how many hours (probably days) it'd take for me to read all those articles. I've read about 20 over the past couple of days. One of them, a profile of Natalie Jermanjinko was great. A couple of others were interesting and another group would have been interesting if I had read them two years ago. _Right around half were not interesting at all._ 

I could try to get through all those articles and links and bookmarks but to what end I don't know. I haven't discussed any of the articles - good or bad - with anyone this week. I haven't posted links on social media. They haven't inspired blog posts or further research. I've just marked them off a list. 

Of course, reading is not bad. Obsessively collecting potential reading material is. I don't want my kids laughing at me anymore (at least not for this) so I'm ready to make a switch. It's time for me to start doing. I want to learn Processing and p5.js, I want to code some tiny node.js apps, I want to write poetry. Obviously I'm going to keep reading but from now on I'm going to focus on reading the things that will show me how to do other things. 

My day will be ruled by unread counts no more!
