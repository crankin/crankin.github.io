<p>Mark Skateboards was a small skateboard company in Austin started by local skater and former high school principal, Mark Gobble. They focused on designing "limited-edition skateboard decks for the discriminating skater and collector." The decks were hand silk-screened and manufactured from sustainable wood.</p>
<p>In order to maintain a consistent look for Mark Skateboards, the graphics and page layout for the website were designed by the the boards' designer, Marc English. I worked with Marc English Design to develop the static page concepts into an interactive site experience based on standards-compliant HTML, CSS, and jQuery. Since the decks and shirts were only available online, the primary focus of the site was the store. In order to keep the site administration as straight-forward as possible, I decided to use the lightweight Stacey CMS instead of a more traditional but likely unnecessarily bloated system.</p>
<p>The store and shopping cart were managed through Big Cartel using their API. Using Big Cartel allowed me to completely customize and integrate the look of the store and allowed Mark Skateboards to manage their inventory and fulfillment needs using a straight-forward, web-based interface instead of needing to learn any code.</p>
