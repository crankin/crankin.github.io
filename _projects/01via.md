After many successful years operating two trailers, Via 313 Pizza opened a new restaurant with an expanded menu. They worked with Marc English Design to redesign their logo and branding prior to opening their new Oak Hill restaurant. I worked with Marc and the Via 313 owners to redesign and update their website.

Marc English Design provided PDF mockups of the site and all Photoshop assets. Since each page has its own singular layout and imagery, I had to hand code each page individually -- the only shared CSS across the site is the navigation box. I designed the phone and tablet versions based on the original mockups with a few performance-related changes. The mobile version has fewer assets per page, does not use background images, and only requires standard system fonts. While it may look different depending on the device or browser, the content -- menus, location information, hours -- is consistent across all versions of the site.

I decided to use Perch for content management as it allowed me to add editable content areas to the individual HTML pages instead of requiring a standardized page template. The Via 313 staff like the straight-forward Perch CMS interface and can easily find the information they need to update with added distractions.
