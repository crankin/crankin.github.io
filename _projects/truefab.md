True Fabrication Bicycles is an Austin-based hand-built custom bicycle shop. After five years in business, the three partners decided to update their website to better reflect their building experience and showcase their bicycles. They wanted to both target new business and be able highlight their bicycles during and after participating in national and regional conferences and competitions.

The single page site uses full-screen background images of True Fab bicycles for each section. The written content is designed to share the page with the large bicycle images. Other pages feature galleries of bicycles and bicycle parts that are incorporated into the site using the Flickr API. I chose to use WordPress as the CMS for the site because blogging is the main communication resource for True Fab partners. The templates are all custom built and coded and utilize custom post fields in order to provide easy editing access for both blogging and updating any of the static information on the site.
