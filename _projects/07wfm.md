At Whole Foods Market, I was responsible for maintaining and updating the website. My main weekly responsibility was designing and updating the homepage with new marquee images that highlighted current contests, company news, and new content on the site. I worked with the marketing and content teams to design and develop special sections of the site to highlight new initiatives including the 2012 Thanksgiving and Holiday pages, the Share the Buzz site, and the announcement of new seafood regulations. I also worked with the social media team to create pages for Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest contests. 

During the Whole Foods website redesign in the summer of 2012, I participated in the development and design of the new homepage and site-wide navigation. I also worked with the team to update and move the site content and images from the original PHP-based pages into the custom Drupal installation.
