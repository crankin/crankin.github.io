Share the Buzz was a Whole Foods Market project that focused on educating store visitors and the community about the declining population of bees throughout North America and their importance to food production. I created a single-page site that incorporated a wide range of action steps to support bee education and colony maintenance from watching a video, to pinning an image to Pinterest, to researching the causes of the bees decreased population through Whole Foods' scientific partners' websites.
  
In order to extend user engagement with the site, I designed and coded some special interactive elements. When the page first loaded, the bees in the top section of the page would "fly" across the browser window and off screen. Also, when a user would hover over any of the bee illustrations, a buzzing bee sound loop would play until the user hovered off the image. While both interactions were minor, I think they resulted in site visitors staying on the page longer and potentially engaging with the material in more depth.
