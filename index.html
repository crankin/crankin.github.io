    <p>crankin is a digital studio located in Austin, Texas. We work with art and cultural organizations, nonprofits, local businesses, artists, architects, and creative individuals to design and develop beautiful and useful interactive products and services.</p>

    <p>We've worked on small and large websites, mobile apps, and a bunch of other online projects. We can guide you through the entire process &mdash; from planning to launch &mdash; or jump in at any stage and work with your in-house creative department or outside design agency.<br><br>
      We work closely with clients to make sure the project meets their goals. And we make sure that we provide them with simple, useable tools they can use to manage or expand the project in the future.</p>

      <p>crankin is also the <i>nom de plume</i> of Christopher Rankin, a web developer / designer / creative coder with over 18 years of public and nonprofit experience working for KLRU, the UT-Austin School of Architecture, the Texas Commission on the Arts, and the Austin Museum of Art.

        <p>The Austin Museum Partnership is a consortium of Austin-area museums organized to promote collaboration and highlight the events and exhibits available across the city. The original organization website was Flash-based and therefore hard for volunteers and member organizations to maintain and update.</p>
        <p>I redesigned the AMP website with the goals of both highlighting the member organizations and providing an easily readable monthly event calendar. I chose WordPress as the CMS because many of the members had previous experience with it and I could customize the admin screens enough to streamline the event creation and organization information editing process. The site is fully responsive and can be viewed across devices so that users can locate museums and events on the go from their phones just as easily as they can from their desktop browser.</p>

        <p class="toolline">WordPress, HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP</p>
        <p>The Casa Montessori website was a pro bono design and development project for a small Austin school that did not previously have an online presence. The staff at Casa wanted to provide the parents of potential students information about the school, its particular educational approach, and the Montessori philosophy.</p>
        <p>My partner and I decided to base the design of the site and the navigation on the trinomial cube, a basic material found in the primary Montessori classroom. Since this was the school's first website, we assisted the staff in writing and editing content for the site. I customized and streamlined the site management by using WordPress and a few select plug-ins to simplify the administrative interface in order to make the content updating process less intimidating to the school's self-admittedly non-technical staff.</p>

        <h4>MARK Skateboards <i>(2011)</i></h4>
        <p class="toolline">interactive design, HTML, CSS, Javascript/jQuery, Stacey CMS, Big Cartel API</p>
        <p>Mark Skateboards was a small skateboard company in Austin started by local skater and former high school principal, Mark Gobble. They focused on designing "limited-edition skateboard decks for the discriminating skater and collector." The decks were hand silk-screened and manufactured from sustainable wood.</p>
        <p>In order to maintain a consistent look for Mark Skateboards, the graphics and page layout for the website were designed by the the boards' designer, Marc English. I worked with Marc English Design to develop the static page concepts into an interactive site experience based on standards-compliant HTML, CSS, and jQuery. Since the decks and shirts were only available online, the primary focus of the site was the store. In order to keep the site administration as uncomplicated as possible, I decided to use the lightweight Stacey CMS instead of a more traditional but likely unnecessarily bloated system.</p>
        <p>The store and shopping cart were managed through Big Cartel using their API. Using Big Cartel allowed me to completely customize and integrate the look of the store and allowed Mark Skateboards to manage their inventory and fulfillment needs using a straightforward, web-based interface instead of needing to learn any code.</p>

        <p>True Fabrication Bicycles is an Austin-based hand-built custom bicycle shop. After five years in business, the three partners decided to update their website to better reflect their building experience and showcase their bicycles. They wanted to both target new business and be able to highlight their bicycles during and after participating in national and regional conferences and competitions.</p>
        <p>The single page site uses full-screen background images of True Fab bicycles for each section. The written content is designed to share the page with the large bicycle images. Other pages feature galleries of bicycles and bicycle parts that are incorporated into the site using the Flickr API. I chose to use WordPress as the CMS for the site because blogging is the main communication resource for True Fab partners. The templates are all custom built and coded and utilize custom post fields in order to provide easy editing access for both blogging and updating any of the static information on the site.</p>

        <p>At Whole Foods Market, I am responsible for maintaining and updating the website. My main weekly responsibility is designing and updating the homepage with new marquee images that highlight current contests, company news, and new content on the site. I work with the marketing and content teams to design and develop special sections of the site to highlight new initiatives including the 2012 Thanksgiving and Holiday pages and the announcement of new seafood regulations. I also work with the social media team to create sites for Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest contests.</p>
        <p>During the Whole Foods website redesign in the summer of 2012, I participated in the development and design of the new homepage and site-wide navigation. I also worked with the team to update and move the site's content and images from the original static PHP pages into the custom Drupal installation.</p>

        <p>Share the Buzz is a Whole Foods Market project that focuses on educating store visitors and the community about the declining population of bees throughout North America and their importance to food production. I created a single-page site that incorporated a wide range of action steps to support bee education and colony maintenance from watching a video, to pinning an image to Pinterest, and researching the causes of the bees decreased population through our scientific partners' websites.</p>
        <p>In order to attract more attention, I included a couple of special interactions. When the page first loaded, the bees in the top section of the page would "fly" across the browser and off screen. Also, hovering over any of the bee illustrations would play a buzzing bee sound loop. While both interactions were minor, I think they resulted in site visitors staying on the page longer and potentially engaging with the material in more depth.</p>

        <p>The website of the University of Texas at Austin School of Architecture (UTSOA) serves the current students, faculty, and staff by providing information on the School's eight program areas in addition to current news, calendar items, course listings, and related University information. The site provides program information and contacts for prospective students. Sections of the site are also used by alumni for school news, events, and career guidance.</p>
        <p>I was hired in January 2005 to overhaul and redesign the School's entire site. After interviewing representative members from each segment of the site's audience, I developed the site structure and navigation scheme that would highlight the many parts of the School to the user in a quick glance.</p>
        <p>In December 2007 I launched a small redesign that refreshed the colors of the original design and incorporated three satellite sites back into the main website. I also developed and deployed a simple content management system that gave staff and faculty the ability to edit pages, update their bios, and upload images. The system was developed in CakePHP and used TinyMCE for the user interface.</p>
        <p>During my employment at UTSOA, I also designed and developed an online events calendar, managed the development of an online room and resource reservation system, and worked with a developer to create a portfolio system that could be used to highlight individual student work and provide a colleciton of images for a course-based online gallery.</p>

        <h4>UTSOA Redesign Proposal <i>(2011)</i></h4>
        <p class="toolline">interface design, graphic design, HTML, CSS, jQuery</p>
        <p>In 2011, I undertook a redesign of the UTSOA site since the current site was over 5 years old, the home-brewed CMS we used was limiting our options to expand the site, and the Flash-based navigation was restricting the ability of visitors to use the site on the device of their choice. The redesign was built using accessible code and based on the ideas of responsive web design so that the site could be used and viewed on the many browsers and devices utilized by the School's audiences.</p>
        <p>The visual design of the site was inspired by the UTSOA logo and the many interconnected layers of the School itself. Instead of organizing the page on a rigid grid, the redesign offered a greater visual interest, encouraged exploration, and allowed for a high degree of user interaction and customization. A more complete sense of the animation and interaction can be seen in these <a href="http://www.bigcheckfactory.com/utsoa-redesign/index5.html">home page</a> and <a href="http://www.bigcheckfactory.com/utsoa-redesign/page5.html">interior page</a> demos.</p>
        <p>The redesign was not realized before I left employment at the School.</p>

        <p>Built and launched in a weekend, the Fire Relief site was created to promote the benefit concert for the families and people who were affected by the wildfires in Central Texas during September 2011. Taking the graphics from the benefit poster designed by Marc English Design, I designed and coded a website with navigation and layout elements that mirrored the poster design and provided more detailed information about the damage caused by the fires and how to help. Using an early version of the 1140 CSS Grid framework allowed me to get the information online quickly with the confidence that it would be viewable across most browsers and devices.</p>
